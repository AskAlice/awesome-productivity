## Windows Software

About this section. Optional. Keep this short and focus on the list.

### Media
- [XSplit](https://www.xsplit.com/) - Most people use OBS these days, but the cool thing about XSplit is it allows you to output to a virtual webcam. This is useful for lots of things, for example in zoom meetings you can screen share with higher framerates, or while another person is also screen sharing.
- [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Wonderful screen capture and file upload tool. Can capture an area/window/monitor as an image/decently compressed video, and upload them to an infinite option of destinations. I have my ShareX configured to upload to a selfhosted image-sharing website via the 'Custom Destinations' feature + REST API, but can also upload to imgur, gfycat, dropbox, etc
- [Johnâ€™s Background Switcher](https://johnsad.ventures/software/backgroundswitcher/) - Can switch your desktop background per-monitor as frequently as every 10 seconds, from many different sources such as Flickr, Google Photos, Unsplash, a local folder, etc

### Development
- [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) - MySQL client with actually decent UX, which is rare for a SQL client.

### Macros

- [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) - Scripting Language that allows you to manipulate windows, send keystrokes/mouse events, and tons of other crazy awesome things.
  - [WindowTransparency.ahk](https://gist.github.com/AskAlice/33c0c405b5ea127f0296e789c70b497b) - Tool to allow you to change the transparency of any window via `CTRL+SHIFT+Scroll Wheel`

## Linux Software

- [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) - Framework for managing zsh your configuration. Complete with themes, plugins, tab completion, etc
- [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) - Overhaul your zsh prompt

## Cross-Platform Software

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Wireframe websites and generate CSS for components. Also has a wonderful pen tool (for vector drawing), It is easier to use than Adobe Illustrator and perhaps just as powerful.
